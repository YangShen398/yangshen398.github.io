Hi, I am Cameron, a software and mechanical engineer with a doctorate in mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in computer science. I have dedicated much of my career to developing software for additive manufacturing, specifically focusing on bridging the gap between design and manufacturing. My journey into programming began with writing Fortran code for finite element analysis. During the final semester of my doctorate program, I encountered a 3D printer for the first time. Like many other engineers, I was captivated by its simplicity and amazed at the possibilities it held. This simple mechanical system, when paired with the right software, has the potential to unlock the true capabilities of 3D manufacturing. This realization sparked my desire to delve into computer science, leading me to earn a master’s degree in the field.

I began my coding journey with Fortran and Matlab. As I delved deeper into numerical computation and data visualization, I honed my skills by extensively working with C/C++, C#, and Python. Later, I embarked on an exciting exploration of web development, embracing a diverse range of technologies and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. These technologies have transformed the web development landscape, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive web experiences. As a lifelong learner, I am committed to exploring new avenues and embracing new challenges. I firmly believe that the pursuit of knowledge is a never-ending journey, and I eagerly anticipate the discoveries and growth that lie ahead.

The more I learn about software, the more I realize its incredible potential to create opportunities. While some may perceive a technology as not yet ready, it is often the challenge of addressing key problems through software solutions that unlocks its true potential. Take, for example, a 3D printer: while its mechanical system is so simple that any engineering student could likely build one from scratch, it is the slicing software that truly makes it usable. The electric vehicle (EV) industry provides another example, demonstrating the crucial role a Battery Management System (BMS) plays. Sometimes, a different perspective is all it takes. Who would have thought that stacking multiple lithium batteries together with a BMS could result in commercially viable products? Had we invested all our resources solely in material science breakthroughs to enhance batteries’ lifespan, energy density, and reliability, we might not have seen such rapid market adoption of EVs. Fundamental research takes decades to yield breakthroughs. We are living in an era full of opportunities—the question is, how do we find them?
