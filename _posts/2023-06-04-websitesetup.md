This website is generated by Jekyll and hosted on Github. For general theme and layout, I am using [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). I also need to write down math equations using Tex but Jekyll doe not support it out of the box. [Jekyll-spaceship](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-spaceship) plugin satisfies all my needs. Pretty neat!
